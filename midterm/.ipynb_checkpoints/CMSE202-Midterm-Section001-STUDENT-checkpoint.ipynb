In particular, you'll practice setting up a GitHub repository, committing and pushing repository changes, downloading data with command line tools, performing some data analysis, possibly using a new Python package, and writing a python class. You should find that you have all of the skills necessary to complete this exam with even just eight weeks of CMSE 202 under your belt!\n",
    "\n",
    "You are encouraged to look through the entire exam before you get started so that you can appropriately budget your time and understand the broad goals of the exam. Once you've read through it, try doing Parts 1 and 2 first so that you have your repository set up and you download all necessary data files as they will be necessary to complete the assigned tasks. Let your instructor know right away if you have problems downloading the data!\n",

That means that you can look up documentation, google how to accomplish certain Python tasks, etc. Being able to effectively use the internet for computational modeling and data science is a very important skill, so we want to make sure you have the opportunity to exercise that skill. **However**: The use of any person-to-person communication software is absolutely not acceptable. If you are seen accessing your email, using a chat program (e.g. Slack), or any sort of collaborative cloud storage or document software (e.g. Google Documents), you will be at risk for receiving a zero on the exam.\n",

    "### Enhancing the Powerball class\n",
    "\n",
    "&#9989; **Question 4.1 (12 points)**: A copy of the original class is provided below. Modify this version of the Powerball class to achieve the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fix the issue that the original author noticed in which two (or more) of the same white ball are drawn (see the result of the above test). There's more than one way to do this. Pursue the approach that makes the most sense to you.\n",
    "2. Add a new attribute to the class called `jackpot`. This value should be set when the class is initialized using a value provided by the user and should be set to `None` by default so that if a value is not specified, a Powerball object can still be created.\n",
    "3. Add a new method called `calculate_cash_payout` that uses the `jackpot` attribute to calculate what the cash payout would be if someone wins that jackpot. The cash payout is 46% of the jackpot value. Set a default argument for this method that sets the fraction of the cash payout to be `0.46`. This method should return the cash payout value (which is the jackpot value times the fraction of the cash payout).\n",
    "4. Right now the white balls do not come out sorted, which is not ideal. Modify the `draw` method to change this so the white balls are sorted in ascending order before they are returned.\n",
    "5. Add a new method called `draw_winning_numbers` that uses the `draw` method to draw a set of winning numbers and stores the result as two new attributes `winning_whites` which should be an array of the 5 white balls and `winning_red` which should be the red ball. This method does not need to return anything.\n",
    "6. Add a new method called `check_numbers` that takes in a list of 5 white balls and a red ball and checks to see if the numbers match the winning numbers (which you should now have as attributes in your class). If they do, it should return `True`, otherwise it should return `False`."
